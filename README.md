# Falcon Dashboard

AtliQ Hardware, a growing hardware company, encountered issues with manual sales reporting and fragmented Excel files, resulting in inefficiencies and delayed decision-making. To address these difficulties, I created a Power BI dashboard that gives real-time sales data, automates reporting, and improves decision-making for stakeholders.
