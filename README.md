# Power BI Dashboard Project

## Project Overview
This project involved building a **Power BI dashboard** for AtliQ Hardware, aimed at enhancing the company's ability to track and analyze real-time sales data. Using a combination of **SQL queries** for data extraction and **Power BI** for visualization, the goal was to provide actionable business insights for the sales and marketing teams.

## AIMS Grid Methodology
The project followed a structured approach using the **AIMS grid** to ensure effective project planning and execution:

- **Purpose**: Address the issue of manual, time-consuming reporting in Excel by automating the sales insights process.
- **Stakeholders**: The marketing, sales, IT (Falcons), and data teams (Data Masters) all collaborated to design and implement the dashboard.
- **End Result**: A **real-time Power BI dashboard** that allows decision-makers to quickly view sales performance by region, product, and customer type.
- **Success Criteria**: The dashboard aimed to reduce manual report generation time by 50% and improve decision-making speed with up-to-date insights.

## Key Features
- **Interactive filters** to view data by market, product, and sales representative.
- **Real-time sales insights** visualized through KPIs like sales amount, profit margin, and quantities sold.
- **Dynamic visuals** that allow for in-depth analysis and comparison over different time periods.

## Data Integration and Transformation
- The data was sourced from an internal **SQL database** containing transaction details, customer information, and market data. 
- The **ETL process** involved extracting the data, transforming it into a usable format, and loading it into Power BI for visualization.

## Technical Stack
- **Power BI**: For creating interactive dashboards and real-time analytics.
- **SQL**: For querying and extracting data.
- **DAX**: For advanced metrics and calculations.

## How to Run the Project
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Connect to the data source (MySQL database or local dataset).
3. Open the Power BI file to explore the dashboard.

## Challenges Faced
One challenge was ensuring that the **SQL database** could handle complex queries without slowing down the operational systems. To solve this, we implemented **optimized queries** and focused on using Power BI's **data modeling** capabilities to minimize the impact on performance.

## Future Improvements
- Integrating more data sources like customer feedback.
- Adding predictive analytics to forecast future sales trends.

## Conclusion
This project sharpened my skills in **Power BI**, **data modeling**, and **SQL**. It provided hands-on experience in building a practical business solution that directly impacted decision-making by delivering real-time insights.
