# Falcon Dashboard

AtliQ Hardware, a growing hardware company, encountered issues with manual sales reporting and fragmented Excel files, resulting in inefficiencies and delayed decision-making. To address these difficulties, I created a Power BI dashboard that gives real-time sales data, automates reporting, and improves decision-making for stakeholders.

## üîç Analysis Overview  

 **Data Overview**:
![Data Overview](https://github.com/Yungssu/PowerBIDashboard/blob/main/atliqERD.png)
   - The Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) depicts AtliQ Hardware's Sales Insights Data Model. This model integrates multiple data tables to facilitate a comprehensive and efficient analysis of sales performance across products, markets, customers, and time periods. The central table, sales transactions, acts as a fact table, while the surrounding tables provide dimensional context.

- **sales transactions (Fact Table)**:
Contains detailed transactional data such as sales_amount, sales_qty, profit_margin, and order_date.
Serves as the central table connecting all dimensions for analysis.

- **sales products (Dimension Table)**:
Contains product details: product_code and product_type.
Linked to sales transactions via product_code.

- **sales customers (Dimension Table)**:
Provides customer details: customer_name, customer_code, and customer_type.
Linked to sales transactions through customer_code.

- **sales markets (Dimension Table)**:
Contains geographical details: markets_code, markets_name, and zone.
Linked to sales transactions via market_code.

- **sales date (Time Dimension Table)**:
Holds date-related information: date, month_name, year, and date_yy_mmm.
Linked to sales transactions via order_date.

- **base_measures (Supporting Table)**:
Includes a pre-calculated measure: Revenue, for advanced reporting.
